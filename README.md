## 🧱 Microservice Architecture

SCMS is built using a modular **microservice architecture** which enables:

- **Scalability**: Each component (attendance, alerts, resource management, analytics) operates independently
- **Fault Tolerance**: Failures in one service don’t crash the whole system
- **Ease of Deployment**: Deploy and update services independently
- **Security**: Segmented access and security policies per service
